1.0.1:
    * Bugfix: Issue headers on "Upcoming" page were not showing committee agendas and sessions that occurred today but still in the past.

1.0.2:
    * Code clean-up: Unnecessary usage of the Django template engine's "|capfirst" and ".capitalize()" functions replaced with more generic way to display names of issues, committees and agendas.
    * Slightly better handling and displaying of datetime.
