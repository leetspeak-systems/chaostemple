A web application for organizing and managing Parliamentary work for the Parliament of Iceland.

The Parliament of Iceland, like other Parliaments, works with vast amounts of issues that contain vast amounts of written material that Members of Parliament, their assistants and the staff of Parliament must examine rather closely.

It was written specifically for use with the Parliament of Iceland and has various features specific to it, for example recognizing actual Members of Parliament when they register an account, presenting them automatically with issues from whatever committee they may be assigned to.
